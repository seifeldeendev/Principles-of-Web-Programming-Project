        <h3>What Is a yurt?</h3>
        <p>
          Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
          Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can
          be opened.
        </p>
        <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
        <p>
          Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
          gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes
          electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
          restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
        </p>
        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
        <p>
          Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also
          pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather
          with layers of clothing.
